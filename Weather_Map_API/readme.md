## Weather App Information

This weather app was created using Apixu which I used because they provide a flexible search where you can find cities by their name or zip code. They also provided weather icons and an excel workbook listing all weather conditions.

This app shows the current temperature, weather icon, weather background image, high/low, feels like info, sunrise and sunset times, and the local time. The app can also convert the information between Celsius and Fahrenheit.
