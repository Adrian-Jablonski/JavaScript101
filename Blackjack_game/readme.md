# Blackjack

## Rules

The player that reaches or is the closest to 21 without going over wins. 

## Gameplay

Select a bet and click Deal to start playing the game.
Once the cards are dealt, select hit to receive another card.

Click stand once you are happy with your cards. The dealer will then be dealt cards and the winner will be decided.

If the player is dealt 21 at the start, the move automatically goes to the dealer and checks if the dealer has 21.

The game is played until one of the player runs out of the $500 starting cash.
